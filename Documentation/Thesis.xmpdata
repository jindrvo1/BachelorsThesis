% Replace the following information with your document's actual
% metadata. If you do not want to set a value for a certain parameter,
% just omit it.
%
% Symbols permitted in metadata
% =============================
% 
% Within the metadata, all printable ASCII characters except
% '\', '{', '}', and '%' represent themselves. Also, all printable
% Unicode characters from the basic multilingual plane (i.e., up to
% code point U+FFFF) can be used directly with the UTF-8 encoding. 
% Consecutive whitespace characters are combined into a single
% space. Whitespace after a macro such as \copyright, \backslash, or
% \sep is ignored. Blank lines are not permitted. Moreover, the
% following markup can be used:
%
%  '\ '         - a literal space  (for example after a macro)                  
%   \%          - a literal '%'                                                 
%   \{          - a literal '{'                                                 
%   \}          - a literal '}'                                                 
%   \backslash  - a literal '\'                                                 
%   \copyright  - the (c) copyright symbol                                      
%
% The macro \sep is only permitted within \Author, \Keywords, and
% \Org.  It is used to separate multiple authors, keywords, etc.

%                      is specified, but can be overridden.
% \Journaltitle      - The title of the journal in which the document
%                      was published. 
% \Journalnumber     - The ISSN for the publication in which the
%                      document was published.
% \Volume            - Journal volume.
% \Issue             - Journal issue/number.
% \Firstpage         - First page number of the published version of
%                      the document.
% \Lastpage          - Last page number of the published version of
%                      the document.
% \Doi               - Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for the
%                      document, without the leading "doi:".
% \CoverDisplayDate  - Date on the cover of the journal issue, as a

\Title        {A statistical evaluation of player or team performance}

\Author       {VojtÄ›ch Jindra}

\Keywords     {ranking\sep rating\sep ranking algorithms\sep ranking systems\sep soccer\sep skill\sep performance}

\Subject      {In the thesis, we introduce multiple ranking algorithms in the context of team sports. Our goal is not only to be able to generate predictions for match outcomes, but to obtain an estimate of the skill of teams and individual players. We try to improve introduced algorithms to make them able to correctly predict more matches than their basic versions, and improve other qualities that make a ranking algorithm a good ranking algorithm. Moreover, in order to improve given algorithms, we use statistical methods which are later used to create a stand-alone ranking algorithm.}
